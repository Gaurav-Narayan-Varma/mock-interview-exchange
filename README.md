### Mock Interview App

### Introduction:
Welcome to Mock interview exchange, the revolutionary platform that helps users improve their coding skills and prepare for job interviews. With Mock interview exchange, users can connect with top-rated interview hosts for free and receive expert guidance that boosts their confidence and increases their chances of success. Mock interview exchange also offers the option to tip hosts with Pie, a user-friendly and inclusive cryptocurrency. Mock Interview Exchange has a distinct advantage over other interview platforms in that it is inclusive, built on Pi, and completely free. This is in contrast to spending hundreds of dollars on mock interviews on other platforms.

### User Journey as User Looking for Mock Interviewer:
Let's walk through a user journey from the perspective of someone who wants to receive a mock interview. First, the user logs into their account, and in this case, the user's name is Peter Pierre. The user then arrives at the market screen, which shows everyone who has given them an interview, people they have interviewed under their mock section, and others they have never met before. Users can choose between technical marks and behavioral mocks. Before we dive into schedule a mock, let's check out Peter's profile. As you can Peter has a brief bio, as well as a list of prior mocks that he either received or gave. Peter also has the option of administering a mock, but more on that later. For now, let's go back to the market, and try to find a technical mock interview!

### Selecting an Interview Host:
The user then has the option to choose between different hosts, including Christina, Judy, and Hillary, for a technical mock interview. Let's choose Christina, who has experience conducting technical interviews and has worked at Google and YouTube, according to her profile. The user can schedule a time with Christina through calendly or research more about her by going to her profile, which includes a mini-resume and positive reviews from previous users.

### Scheduling the Interview:
The user then signs up and returns to the tab to find a suitable time for the mock interview with Christina. Moxie sends a calendar link to the user, allowing them to schedule the interview. The platform automatically updates the user when the interview is nearing its start time.

### User Journey as User Looking for Mock Interview:
In this demo, we will go through a user experience where the user wants to administer interviews. The user will log in as Peter Pure and go to their profile, where they can click on "Do Interviews" to conduct an interview. By clicking on "Do Interviews," the user can provide their Calendly URL, which includes all available times, and a Zoom link for the interviewee to reach them at the time of the interview. The user can also set a possible ballpark for how many Pie they would expect as a tip from completing the interview. For this example, let's stick with conducting technical interviews and click on "Done." The interview is now confirmed.

### Accepting an Interview Request:
The great thing about Mock Interview Exchange is that it notifies users when another user accepts their interview services. The user will receive a notification that Joe Jobseeker wants to be interviewed by them on a specific date and is a five-star interviewee willing to tip two Pi Network coin. The user can either accept, decline or read more about Joe's profile. For this example, let's click "Accept."

### Notification and Scheduling:
Mock Interview Exchange will notify the user within 24 hours before the interview begins. The user can check their calendar to see all planned mock interviews, either ones they are receiving or ones they are administering.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, Mock Interview Exchange is a platform built on the Pi Network that allows users to improve their interview skills and gain confidence. The user experience of administering interviews is straightforward and convenient, with options to set available times, provide a Zoom link, and set a possible tip expectation. The platform also notifies users when someone accepts their interview services, making scheduling interviews easy and efficient.
